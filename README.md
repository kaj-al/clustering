Clustering is a way to group similar data points together. Think of it as organizing a messy closet—items that are alike end up in the same section. Unlike other machine learning methods, clustering doesn’t need labeled data. It’s all about finding patterns in your data.<br>

How It Works<br>
--Pick the features that describe your data.<br>
--Choose a clustering method (like K-Means or DBSCAN).<br>
--Let the algorithm group similar items together.<br>
--Check and understand the clusters—what story do they tell?<br>

Popular Types
--K-Means: Divides data into k groups around central points.<br>
--Hierarchical: Builds a tree of clusters (big groups split into smaller ones).<br>
--Density-Based (DBSCAN): Finds clusters based on dense regions—good for weirdly shaped groups.<br>

Why Use Clustering?
--Customer Segmentation – group shoppers with similar tastes.<br>
--Image Segmentation – identify regions in images.<br>
--Anomaly Detection – spot unusual patterns (fraud, errors, outliers).<br>
--Document Organization – group articles by topics.<br>
